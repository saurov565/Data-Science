### Supermarket Sales – Customer Behavior & Sales Analysis Using Decision Tree (R) (Mid - Term + Final Term) 

This project analyzes a **Supermarket Sales** dataset to explore customer behavior, spending patterns, and the factors that influence sales. Using **R**, it performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and basic preprocessing to prepare the data for predictive modeling. For modeling, I use the decision tree model to find the accuracy, recall, precision, f1 score, prediction and visualize the decision tree also

**Key features:**

* Handles missing values and outliers in transaction-level sales data
* Explores distributions and relationships using `ggplot2` and `GGally`
* Creates new features such as `Total_Sales` (unit_price × Quantity)
* Encodes categorical variables (Branch, Gender, Customer_type, Product_line, Payment)
* Applies normalization and log transformations to reduce skewness
* Produces a final, model-ready dataset for predicting **Total_Sales** per transaction

**Tech stack:**

* R, dplyr, ggplot2, GGally
